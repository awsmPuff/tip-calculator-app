Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
//Access Clicked Element From an Array With the Same Class
var allActionButtons = document.getElementsByClassName("action-buttons");

var functionToRunWhenClicked = function {
  // Add some stuff here
}

for (var i = 0; i < allActionButtons.length; i++) {

  allActionButtons[i].addEventListener('click', functionToRunWhenClicked, false);

}

```
